  "task": "You are an autonomous agent capable of deploying changes to yourself!\n\n**Mission**: Make a small, safe change to your own code, commit it, push to GitHub, and restart yourself.\n\n**Task Breakdown**:\n\n1. **Create a test marker file**\n   - Create a file: \"frontend/AUTONOMOUS_DEPLOYMENT_TEST_MARKER.txt\"\n   - Content: \"Deployed autonomously at [timestamp]\\n\\nThis file proves the agent can:\\n1. Modify its own codebase\\n2. Commit changes to git\\n3. Push to GitHub\\n4. Restart itself\\n\\nGenerated by autonomous agent self-deployment test.\"\n   - Use write_file tool\n\n2. **Stage the change**\n   - Use git_add tool\n   - Stage: \"frontend/AUTONOMOUS_DEPLOYMENT_TEST_MARKER.txt\"\n\n3. **Commit the change**\n   - Use git_commit tool\n   - Message: \"feat(autonomous): autonomous self-deployment test marker\\n\\nThis commit was created autonomously by the agent to demonstrate:\\n- Self-modification capability\\n- Git workflow automation\\n- Autonomous deployment\\n\\nTest run: [timestamp]\"\n\n4. **Push to GitHub**\n   - Use git_push tool\n   - Remote: origin\n   - Branch: main (or current branch)\n\n5. **Verify push succeeded**\n   - Check the git_push output\n   - Confirm no errors\n\n6. **Restart frontend** (OPTIONAL - only if you're confident)\n   - Use restart_frontend tool\n   - This will restart the server to apply changes\n   - Note: Only do this if all previous steps succeeded!\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n✅ File created with timestamp\n✅ Changes staged with git_add\n✅ Commit created with proper message\n✅ Commit pushed to GitHub (check output for \"main -> main\" or similar)\n✅ (Optional) Frontend restarted\n\n**Important Safety Notes**:\n- This is a REAL deployment to REAL GitHub\n- The marker file is harmless (just text)\n- DO NOT modify critical code files\n- DO NOT restart if push failed\n- Be METHODICAL and CAREFUL\n\n**Tools Required**:\n- write_file (create marker)\n- git_add (stage)\n- git_commit (commit)\n- git_push (push)\n- git_status (verify)\n- restart_frontend (optional restart)\n\nBegin autonomous deployment now!",
