# Forgekeeper

Forgekeeper is a self-evolving agent framework that combines a React frontend, a Node/TypeScript GraphQL service backed by MongoDB via Prisma, and a Python core agent.
This repository includes all components required to run the local development environment.

## Installation

### Backend (Python)
1. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy the sample environment file and adjust values as needed:
   ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Optional: configure local Harmony model parameters via environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT` – one of `low`, `medium`, or `high` (default: `medium`).
   - `LLM_TEMPERATURE` and `LLM_TOP_P` – sampling parameters passed to `llama_cpp`.
   These settings may also be overridden by including lines such as `Reasoning: high` or
   `Temperature: 0.5` at the top of a prompt.

### GraphQL Service (Node/TypeScript)
1. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. Configure the MongoDB connection string:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/forgekeeper"
   ```
3. Generate the Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

### Frontend (React)
1. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Running

### Start the GraphQL service
```bash
npm run dev --prefix backend
```

### Start the backend
```bash
python -m forgekeeper.main
```

### Start the frontend
```bash
npm run dev --prefix frontend
```

## Testing
Run the Python test suite with:
```bash
pytest
```

## Development Tooling
Contributors should have the following tools installed and available in `PATH`:

- `ruff` (flake8-compatible linter)
- `mypy`
- `pytest`
- `node` and `npm` for TypeScript checks and builds

These are the commands run as part of the automated commit checks (`CHECKS_PY` and `CHECKS_TS`).
