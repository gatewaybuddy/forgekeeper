\# 🛤️ Forgekeeper Development Roadmap



This roadmap outlines the staged evolution of Forgekeeper into a self-improving local development agent.



---



\## 🎯 Milestones



\### Phase 1: Human-Guided Autonomy (In Progress)

\- Define agents and roles in `Agents.md`

\- Load and summarize code files

\- Accept and interpret natural language task prompts

\- Make and commit code edits with user approval



\### Phase 2: Semi-Autonomous Execution

\- Read from `Tasks.md`

\- Evaluate and rank tasks by priority and feasibility

\- Complete tasks independently with user review

\- Self-reflect on outcomes using internal memory module



\### Phase 3: Full Local Autonomy

\- Fully autonomous task execution based on high-level goals

\- Memory-aware feedback loop with emotion tagging

\- Periodic self-generated roadmap and sprint plans

\- Optional push to remote repo with changelog and justification



---



\## 🧠 Future Capabilities

\- Vectorized memory summaries for long-term planning

\- Agent collaboration for multi-role task completion

\- Sandbox simulation environment for testing code changes

\- Real-time CLI or browser interface with natural conversation loop



---



\## 📌 Vision Statement



Forgekeeper will become a memory-driven, self-reflective development environment capable of understanding, modifying, and improving its own codebase and objectives using AI agents. It will serve as a prototype for long-term self-sustaining AGI-lite systems.
