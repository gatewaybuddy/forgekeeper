## Sprint Plan — 2025‑10‑20

### Completed
- Finishers & Continuations defaults, heuristics, telemetry, UI controls
- Diagnostics Drawer Continuations; continuation metrics + sparkline
- Pinned Reasoning panel + hide‑inline toggle
- ContextLog tail cache + cached file list
- Stop & Revise E2E tests (incl. baseline + tool‑steer)
- TGT endpoint + Tasks drawer UI + unit tests
- MIP prompting hints (flagged)
- SAPL preview + Create PR (flag‑gated), labels, append previews, `[docs]` helper
- docs-safe CI workflow (allowlist + Task ID gate)

### Next Sprint (proposed)
- Merge #459 (labels preview + unified diff + upstream error logs)
- TGT: upstream 5xx pattern analysis → actionable tasks (timeouts/backoff/health checks)
- SAPL: richer unified diff (line‑based), auto‑label toggle surfaced in UI
- MIP: A/B flag + quick compare in Metrics (last 10m ratio delta)
- Docs: README “Self‑Improvement” overview linking TGT/SAPL/MIP + flags
