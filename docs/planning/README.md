# Planning Hub

The planning hub consolidates the active roadmap, sprint backlog, and improvement initiatives so contributors share a single source of truth.

## Core Artifacts
- [`../../ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md): Strategic phases, milestones, and capability targets.
- [`SprintPlan.md`](SprintPlan.md): Current sprint goals and work-in-progress tracking.
- [`self_improvement_plan.md`](self_improvement_plan.md): Structured improvement initiatives and automation upgrades.
- [`session_2025-10-20.md`](session_2025-10-20.md): Latest detailed working session log.

## How to Use This Hub
1. **Start with the roadmap** to understand strategic context and major milestones.
2. **Review the sprint plan** to identify active tasks and their owners.
3. **Check the session log** for the most recent decisions, blockers, and follow-ups.
4. **Update artifacts in tandem:** when a sprint or session concludes, reflect the outcome here and cross-link from the roadmap summary.

## Guardrails & Policies
All planning documents adhere to the shared delivery guardrails in [`../policies/guardrails.md`](../policies/guardrails.md). Reference that document rather than duplicating policy text within planning files.

## Next Steps for Consolidation
- Capture new sessions in date-stamped Markdown files within this directory.
- When starting a new sprint, archive the prior `SprintPlan.md` with a dated filename and generate a fresh plan for the upcoming window.
- Ensure any automation or self-improvement work added to the roadmap is also tracked in the sprint plan and vice versa.
