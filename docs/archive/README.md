## Archive Policy

Documentation is archived when:
1. Feature/design is no longer part of active roadmap
2. Implementation approach has been superseded
3. Content is outdated but has historical value
4. Multiple migration/refactor docs exist from old architectures

**Note**: Archived docs may contain useful patterns or designs for future reference, but should not be treated as current system documentation.
