It's useful for maintaining consistency and adapting the Core's responses according to the specified identity.\n\n3. **task_routing**: This tool allows Core to make decisions about whether to answer a question directly or delegate the task to another process or tool. It\u2019s used for efficient task management.\n\n4. **memory_access**: This tool provides Core with the ability to read and write its memory state. This includes accessing goals, past interactions, and any other relevant memory data.\n\n5. **postprocess_response**: This tool is used to apply formatting cleanup to the outgoing text.

While I can't directly execute code or write to your filesystem, I can guide you through the process of how you might set this up programmatically.\n\nHere's a conceptual outline that you can follow:\n\n1. **Define the Task**: Clearly define what you want the function to do. This will be useful for both writing the function and calling it later.\n\n2. **Generate the Function Code**: You can use a code generation tool or script to create your desired function. This step might involve using an AI model capable of generating code based on your specifications.\n\n3. **Write the Function to a File**: Save the generated function code to your specified directory (`forgekeeper/functions`) as a `.py` file, for example.\n\n4. **Dynamically Load and Execute the Function**: Use Python's import capabilities to load and execute the function when needed.\n\nHere's a simple example in Python:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Task\nLet's say you want a function that adds two numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Generate the Function Code\nYou can manually write this function or use a tool to do so. Here\u2019s a simple example function:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Function to a File\nYou can save the above function in a file, e.g., `forgekeeper/functions/add_numbers.py`.\n\n```python\nfunction_code = \"\"\"\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\"\"\"\n\nwith open('forgekeeper/functions/add_numbers.py', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(function_code)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Dynamically Load and Execute the Function\nYou can use Python's importlib to load the module and call the function.\n\n```python\nimport importlib.util\nimport os\n\ndef load_function(module_name, function_name):\n    module_path = os.path.join('forgekeeper', 'functions', f'{module_name}.py')\n    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(module_name, module_path)\n    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)\n    spec.loader.exec_module(module)\n    return getattr(module, function_name)\n\n# Usage\nadd_func = load_function('add_numbers', 'add_numbers')\nresult = add_func(3, 5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 8\n```\n\n### Considerations\n- **Security**: Be cautious when dynamically importing and executing code, especially if the code comes from untrusted sources.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage cases where the file or function might not exist.\n- **Modular Design**: Keep your code modular to facilitate easier maintenance and testing.\n\nThis setup should allow you to generate a function dynamically, save it, and call it later as needed. Adjust the specifics to suit your exact use case and requirements."

You can adjust the weights and normalization values to better fit your specific use case. If you provide more details about the factors and context, I can help refine this example further."

The specifics of the function will depend on what factors you want to include in your risk assessment.

Here's a basic example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_risk_score(age, income, credit_score):\n    # Define weights for each factor\n    age_weight = 0.3\n    income_weight = 0.2\n    credit_score_weight = 0.5\n\n    # Normalize the input values (this is a simple normalization example)\n    max_age = 100\n    max_income = 200000\n    max_credit_score = 850\n\n    normalized_age = age / max_age\n    normalized_income = income / max_income\n    normalized_credit_score = credit_score / max_credit_score\n\n    # Calculate the risk score\n    risk_score = (age_weight * normalized_age +\n                  income_weight * (1 - normalized_income) +\n                  credit_score_weight * (1 - normalized_credit_score))\n\n    # Return the risk score, ensuring it's within a 0-1 range\n    return min(max(risk_score, 0), 1)\n\n# Example usage\nage = 45\nincome = 50000\ncredit_score = 700\n\nrisk_score = calculate_risk_score(age, income, credit_score)\nprint(f\"Calculated Risk Score: {risk_score:.2f}\")\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- I assigned weights to each factor, which determine their influence on the risk score.\n- I normalized each input to be between 0 and 1.\n- I calculated the risk score using a weighted sum of the normalized inputs.\n\nYou can adjust the weights and normalization process based on your specific requirements and domain expertise.

This ranking helps in selecting sentences that are most representative of the text's overall meaning.\n\n5. **Summary Extraction**: The function finally extracts the top-ranked sentences based on the specified `max_sentences` parameter, ensuring the summary is concise yet informative.\n\nThis design is chosen because it balances efficiency and effectiveness.

I can't wait to try it out with other berries and maybe some other fruits too. I'll probably make a strawberry one for the 4th of July. I haven't decided for sure yet, but I'm leaning towards it. It would be perfect for the holiday. I have the perfect little dish too, but I'll save that for later.\\n\\nI'll make it up ahead of time so that I can just add the whipped cream at the last minute. That way it's not too soupy. I like my parfaits to be on the thicker side, but I think that's just my preference. I like how they are layered. It makes them look so pretty too. I've been eating them for breakfast with my coffee. I make them the night before and in the morning I just add the whipped cream and I have a perfect breakfast. I love how simple it is.\\n\\nThis one was so good. I think I might try a peach version next week. I haven't had a peach parfait in so long and I think that it's about time I make one. I'll probably use fresh peaches since they are in season right now, but canned would work too.

In a medium saucepan combine the blueberries, sugar, water, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Bring to a simmer over medium low heat. Let it cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until the berries are soft and the liquid has thickened. Stir occasionally. Once done, let it cool to room temperature.\\n\\nNext, make the whipped cream. In a large bowl, combine the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Using an electric mixer, beat until soft peaks form.\\n\\nNow it's time to make the parfaits. In a bowl combine the yogurt with about 1/2 cup of the blueberry compote. Stir together to combine. In two glasses, layer 1/2 of the yogurt compote, 1/4 cup of the granola, and the whipped cream. Repeat until all of the ingredients are used up.\\n\\nEnjoy immediately, or cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\\n\\nSource: Blueberry Compote from The View From Great Island\"}"
